# MafiAStarLite

This is a project designed to make querying an UltraStar song database accessible via a webbrowser. It can display available songs from a database in a presentable fashion, as well as the songs' cover images.
Also, this project features an easy PDF generation for the automated creation of songlists, and provides easy-to-run database update scripts that can be used to update the database automatically.
